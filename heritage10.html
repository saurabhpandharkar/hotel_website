            Regarded as one of the popular Historical Places in Goa, this fort lies 18 km ahead of Panaji.<br>
             This fort was constructed in the year 1612. <br>
             Overlooking the Sinquerim Beach, this magnificent fort used to act as a landmark for goods arriving from Europe.<br>

            At the same time, the strategic post of this fort was also used as a means of guard against the Dutch and Maratha invaders.<br>
             It is known that the construction of the lower section of the fort consists of a Bastion. <br>
             The fort served as an anchoring point for ships arriving from the sea, during the 16th and 17th century.
