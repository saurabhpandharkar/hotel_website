            Easily accessible via ferry ride from Querim, the fort is on the list of some of the famous Historical Places to Visit in Goa.
            <br> The fort was constructed on the orders of Maharaja Khem Sawant Bhonsle, who was the king of Sawantwadi during the advent of the seventeenth century.<br>
            <br>

            The hilltop location of the fort gives some of the most exhilarating views of the Arabian sea from its ranks. <br>
            Due to its location, the fort gained immense importance for maritime defences,<br>
             which is why it was completely revamped by the Portuguese in 1746.<br>
              Today, the fort, which remained in a state of ruins for years, has been converted into a hotel by the name of Fort Tiracol Heritage.
