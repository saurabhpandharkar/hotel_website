            Owned by the Goa government, the Reis Magos Fort is among the popular ancient monuments in Goa. <br>The 400 year old fort, constructed in the year 1551 happens to be one of the oldest forts in Goa.<br> It is believed that the name of the fort was laid after three men from the Bible.<br> Today, the fort falls under the ownership of the Goa government and finds itself on the list of Goa ancient monuments.<br>It has been fully restored and serves as a heritage centre in the town. <br>

            What started as a defence fortress, this fort has served multiple uses as a jail and then a hospital.<br> Back in 1993, the fort was completely abandoned and left to perish in a neglected state.<br> After being renovated, the fort was opened to the general public in the year 2012.<br> At present, the fort serves under a guided vision and mission to promote cultural heritage in Goa. <br>This is why, it has also become a centre for displaying numerous exhibitions, fairs, festivals and educational events. <br>
            
            The fort is built in a typical fusion style of architecture, combining Hindu and Portuguese styles.<br> It is known that the altitude of the fort gives a splendid view of the surrounding sea and landscape of Goa.<br> It is also home to several artefacts, including 7 guns from the Portuguese era. 
            <br>The place is well connected with major railways stations, including Karmali, Verna, and Vasco da Gama.<br> One can also get here by plane through the Dabolim airport.
